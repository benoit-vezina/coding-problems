// ðŸ”¹ Problem 3: Minimum Number of Steps to Reach a Target Number (Medium)
// Description:
// You start at 0. At each step i, you can choose to either move forward by +i or backward by -i. Whatâ€™s the minimum number
// of steps needed to reach a given number target?

// Why BFS?
// Each state (current number, step count) is a node. BFS explores all reachable numbers level-by-level to find the
// shortest sequence to reach target.
